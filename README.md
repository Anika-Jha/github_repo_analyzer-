# github_repo_analyzer-

Hey everyone! I'm Anika, and this is my GitHub Repo Analyzer — a streamlined, interactive dashboard that takes any public GitHub repo and breaks it down visually. You can drop in a repo link, and instantly get a summary of stars, forks, top contributors, commit activity, and more — all fetched live from GitHub's API.

repo should be public.
